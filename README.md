# Cxcl13_project

## R version 
In this project R version 3.6.0 was used.

## Single-cell Data Analysis
The single-cell analysis was performed using the Seurat R-package. Versions for the various analysis parts can be found at the bottom of the analysis document. 

### Seurat single-cell parameters
Seurat single cell parameters, such as cluster-resolution and number of PCA dimensions used for UMAP dimensionality reduction can be found in the /design/sc.design.file.csv for each subanalysis. 

### Results can be reviewd at these URLs:
